# Neural Network From Scratch
I decided to design and build a Two-Layer Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Classification (MNIST Dataset) using only NumPy, Python, and a little bit of Pandas.

I decided to use a Kaggle Notebook as it makes it very easy to load datasets. This was helpful in my case as I wanted to load the MNIST Dataset which can be found [here](www.google.com)
